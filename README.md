# Note Taker - University

This project aims to provide a simple experience when taking notes on higher education levels - and yet filled with many features that will, if needed, give all the needed tools, and more beyond.

Security **WILL NOT** be our biggest concern during the development phase. We will however later on, once we believe that the first real version is finished, have our focus on making patches, fixes, updates, and so on, and once finished with that we aim to focus on the later version releases.

This project version, will aim to provide the needed tools to be used on a local-host basis. Meaning, on your local server/computer/laptop/etc. We make use of *XAMPP* ourselves, and will be providing an install-tutorial later on here in this description.

Either way, this is an open source project, and we do encourage people to participate in the development.

Many thanks, and welcome.
